<h2><b>1. What is HTML?</b></h2>
<pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A.HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
It is the standard language used to create web pages and structure content on the web. 
HTML describes the structure of web pages using elements (tags) like headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.</pre>
<h2><b>2.What is the use of h1 tag</b></h2>
<pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A.The h1 tag in HTML is used to define the most important heading on a webpage. Here's how it's used and why it's important:
 <b>Purpose:</b>
 Defines a top-level heading (typically the title or main topic of a section or page).
 Improves SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines give more weight to text inside h1 tags.
 Enhances accessibility: Screen readers use heading tags like h1 to help users navigate a page easily.
 Organizes content: It visually and semantically separates the main topic from the rest of the content.</pre>
 <h2><b>3.What is the use of the ul tag?</b></h2>
 <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A.The ul tag in HTML is used to create an unordered list, which is a list of items that do not require a specific order.
<b>Purpose:</b>
Displays a bulleted list of items (as opposed to a numbered list, which uses ol).
Helps organize related pieces of information visually and semantically.
Useful for navigation menus, feature lists, steps that donâ€™t need order, etc.
<h2><b>4.Is it possible to change an inline element into a block-level element?</b></h2><pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A.Yes, it is absolutely possible to change an inline element into a block-level element using CSS.
<b>How to do it:</b>
You can use the display property in CSS to change how an element behaves in terms of layout.
<b>What this does:</b>
Inline elements (like span, a, strong) do not break onto a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
Block-level elements (like div, p, h1) do break onto a new line and take up the full width of their container by default.
By using display: block, you're telling the browser to treat an inline element like a block-level one.
</pre><h2><b>5.What is the use of the alt attribute in HTML?</b></h2><pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">A.The alt attribute in HTML is used to provide alternative text for an image (<img> element).
Primary purposes of the alt attribute:
<b>Accessibility:</b>
Screen readers use the alt text to describe the image to users who are blind or visually impaired.
Helps make web content more inclusive.
<b>Fallback content:</b>
If an image cannot be displayed (due to an error, slow connection, or if images are disabled), the alt text appears in its place.
<b>SEO (Search Engine Optimization):</b>
Search engines use alt text to understand the content of images, which can improve the page's search rankings.
